HomeExpenseCalculator
=====================

A simple app which allows the user to create categories for Income and expenses,
input the Expense and the Income in the corresponding categories.

The idea is to calculate the amount spent on each category and tally it with the income,
giving the user a detailed report on Expense,Income and Savings at the end of the month or the year.
